// Sass @extend Directive
// The @extend directive lets you share a set of CSS properties from one selector to another.

// The @extend directive is useful if you have almost identically styled elements that only differ in some small details.

// The following Sass example first creates a basic style for buttons (this style will be used for most buttons). 
// Then, we create one style for a "Report" button and one style for a "Submit" button. Both "Report" and "Submit" button inherit all the 
// CSS properties from the .button-basic class, through the @extend directive. In addition, they have their own colors defined:

body {
    background: silver;
    display: flex;
    place-content: center;
}

.button-basic  {
    border: none;
    padding: 15px 30px;
    text-align: center;
    font-size: 16px;
    cursor: pointer;
    margin-top: 100px;
}
  
.button-report  {
    @extend .button-basic;
    background-color: red;
}
  
.button-submit  {
    @extend .button-basic;
    background-color: green;
    color: white;
}


// By using the @extend directive, you do not need to specify several classes for an element in your HTML code, 
// like this: <button class="button-basic button-report">Report this</button>. 
// You just need to specify .button-report to get both sets of styles.

// The @extend directive helps keep your Sass code very DRY.
